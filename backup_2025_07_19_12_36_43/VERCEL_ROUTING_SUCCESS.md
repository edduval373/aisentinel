# VERCEL ROUTING SUCCESS - Code is Loading!

## Great Progress! 
The deployment is working and I can see your AI Sentinel code is being served by Vercel. The issue is just routing - it's showing the raw JavaScript instead of executing the React app.

## What I Can See Working:
- ✅ Database connection code (PostgreSQL with Drizzle)
- ✅ All storage models (users, companies, aiModels, etc.)
- ✅ Server infrastructure compiled successfully
- ✅ Your complete codebase is deployed and accessible

## The Fix: Correct Routing for React SPA

### Updated Routing Strategy:
```json
{
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/api/(.*)",
      "dest": "/api/index.js"
    },
    {
      "src": "/assets/(.*)",
      "dest": "/dist/public/assets/$1"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/dist/public/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

### What This Does:
- **API Routes**: Go to serverless function
- **Assets**: CSS/JS files load correctly  
- **Everything Else**: Serves React app's index.html (SPA routing)

## Expected Result:
Your AI Sentinel React application will load properly showing:
- Login/authentication interface
- Multi-model AI chat
- Admin dashboard
- All your enterprise features

The code is definitely there and compiled - just need the router to serve index.html instead of raw files!

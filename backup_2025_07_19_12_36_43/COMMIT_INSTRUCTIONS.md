# Commit the Vercel Fix

## What was fixed:
- Fixed `vercel.json` configuration error: "The 'functions' property cannot be used in conjunction with the 'builds' property"
- Moved `maxDuration` setting from `functions` to `builds[1].config`
- This resolves the deployment error you saw

## How to commit using Replit Version Control:

1. **Click the Version Control icon** in the left sidebar (looks like a branching tree)
2. **Stage the changes**:
   - Check the box next to `vercel.json`
3. **Add commit message**: 
   ```
   Fix Vercel configuration - remove functions property conflict
   ```
4. **Click "Commit & Push"**

## Expected result:
- GitHub will receive the updated vercel.json
- Your Vercel project should automatically start deploying
- The deployment error should be resolved

## If automatic deployment doesn't trigger:
1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Click "Deployments" tab
3. Click "Redeploy" to manually trigger deployment

The configuration is now correct and should deploy successfully!

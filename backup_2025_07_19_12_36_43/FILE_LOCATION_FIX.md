# Final Import Extension Fixes for Deployment

## Current Progress ✅
- ✅ Package.json build script: WORKING
- ✅ Vite configuration: CORRECT
- ✅ App.tsx corruption: FIXED
- ✅ Landing page: UPLOADED (43 modules transformed!)
- ❌ Home page import missing .tsx extension

## Current Issue
`Could not load /vercel/path0/client/src/pages/home`

## Solution Strategy
Add `.tsx` extensions to ALL page imports in App.tsx for consistent production builds.

## Required Changes in GitHub App.tsx

**Update these import lines:**
```tsx
// Current (causing errors):
import Home from "@/pages/home";
import Login from "@/pages/Login";
import VerificationSuccess from "@/pages/VerificationSuccess";

// Should be:
import Home from "@/pages/home.tsx";
import Login from "@/pages/Login.tsx";
import VerificationSuccess from "@/pages/VerificationSuccess.tsx";
```

## Why This Fix Works
- Vite in production mode requires explicit file extensions
- Different from development environment behavior
- Consistent extension usage prevents build failures

## Expected Final Result
- ✅ All React components load successfully
- ✅ Vite build completes without errors
- ✅ AI Sentinel deploys to Vercel
- ✅ Production application accessible

## We're Almost There!
Just need to add .tsx extensions to remaining page imports and the deployment will succeed completely.

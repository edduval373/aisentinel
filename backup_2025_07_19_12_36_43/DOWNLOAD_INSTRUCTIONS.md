# Step 2: Download Your Project Files

## How to Download from Replit
1. **In the Replit Files panel** (left sidebar)
2. **Right-click on the root folder** (the top-level folder containing all your files)
3. **Select "Download as ZIP"**
4. **Save the ZIP file** to your computer
5. **Extract the ZIP file** to a folder

## Clean Up Files Before Upload
After extracting, delete these folders/files (if they exist):
- `node_modules/` folder
- `dist/` folder  
- `.git/` folder (if visible)
- `.replit` file
- Any `.log` files

## Keep These Important Files
Make sure these are in your extracted folder:
- ✅ `package.json`
- ✅ `vercel.json`
- ✅ `api/` folder (with index.ts)
- ✅ `client/` folder
- ✅ `server/` folder
- ✅ `shared/` folder
- ✅ `tsconfig.json`
- ✅ `tailwind.config.ts`
- ✅ `vite.config.ts`
- ✅ `drizzle.config.ts`

## Next Step
Once you've downloaded and cleaned up the files, let me know and I'll guide you through creating the new GitHub repository.

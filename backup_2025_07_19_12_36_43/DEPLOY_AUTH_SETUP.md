# DEPLOYMENT AUTHENTICATION SETUP

## Current Status
Your AI Sentinel is successfully deployed with beautiful styling. The difference between local and deployed versions:

- **Local Preview**: Shows authenticated Home page (logged in user)
- **Vercel Deployment**: Shows Landing page (unauthenticated user)

Both pages are beautifully designed - you're seeing different views based on authentication status.

## To Access Full Application on Vercel

### Option 1: Click "Sign In" on Landing Page
1. Visit your Vercel deployment URL
2. Click "Sign In" or "Get Started" button
3. Complete authentication flow
4. Access the full AI Sentinel interface

### Option 2: Configure Environment Variables
Set up these environment variables in Vercel project settings:
- `DATABASE_URL`: Your PostgreSQL connection string
- `SENDGRID_API_KEY`: For email verification
- `APP_URL`: Your Vercel deployment URL

### Option 3: Enable Demo Mode (Show Main Interface Immediately)
I can modify the app to show the main interface without requiring authentication for demo purposes.

## Current Beautiful Interface
Your landing page has the same high-quality styling as the main app:
- Professional "Enterprise AI Governance" branding
- Beautiful gradient backgrounds and styling
- Feature cards and security highlights
- Consistent design language throughout

The authentication flow is working correctly - users just need to sign in to access the full platform.

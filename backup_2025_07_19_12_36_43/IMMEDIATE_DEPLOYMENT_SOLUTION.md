# IMMEDIATE DEPLOYMENT SOLUTION

## Current Status
- ✅ Build is working (no more runtime errors)
- ❌ Getting 404 NOT_FOUND on deployed site
- ✅ Vercel deployment infrastructure operational

## Problem Analysis
The 404 error indicates the serverless function is being built but not properly routed. This is a common issue with TypeScript compilation paths.

## Solution: Simplified Routing

### Updated vercel.json (Simplified)
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "api/index.ts",
      "use": "@vercel/node"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/api/index.js"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Key Changes
- **Single build target**: Only build api/index.ts specifically
- **Simplified routing**: All requests go to the single function
- **Direct path**: Clear compilation from .ts to .js

### Expected Result
- ✅ Vercel will build the TypeScript function correctly
- ✅ All routes will be handled by our serverless function
- ✅ Landing page will display with deployment success
- ✅ Health check API will work at /api/health

## Next Steps After Upload
1. Upload simplified vercel.json
2. Test deployment at your Vercel URL
3. Should see beautiful AI Sentinel landing page
4. Confirm /api/health endpoint works

## Why This Works
- Eliminates routing confusion
- Clear build target
- Single function handles everything
- Proven Vercel deployment pattern

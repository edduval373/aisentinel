# Upload the Security Fix

## Important: Include the Email Service Fix
Make sure to upload the updated `server/services/emailService.ts` file that I just fixed to remove the hardcoded SendGrid API key.

## How to Complete Upload
1. **In your new GitHub repository**
2. **Upload the updated `server` folder** (contains the security fix)
3. **Or specifically upload**: `server/services/emailService.ts`
4. **Commit message**: "Remove hardcoded SendGrid API key - security fix"

## Files to Double-Check Are Uploaded
- ✅ `package.json`
- ✅ `vercel.json` 
- ✅ `api/` folder
- ✅ `client/` folder
- ✅ `server/` folder (with security fix)
- ✅ `shared/` folder
- ✅ Config files

## Why Not Git Push from Replit
- Git is corrupted (lock file issue)
- Remote points to deleted repository
- Manual upload is cleaner and safer

## GitHub Name Case Change
- GitHub usernames are case-insensitive
- Your repositories will work fine
- No issues with Vercel connection

Continue with your manual uploads - this is actually the safest approach given the git corruption!

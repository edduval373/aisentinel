# Critical Missing Files - Upload Required

## Problem Identified
Your GitHub repository is missing the entire React application source code. Only `index.html` exists in the client folder.

## Missing Critical Directory Structure
```
client/
├── index.html ✓ (exists)
└── src/ ❌ (MISSING ENTIRE DIRECTORY)
    ├── App.tsx
    ├── main.tsx
    ├── index.css
    ├── components/
    ├── hooks/
    ├── lib/
    └── pages/
```

## Required Action
You need to upload the entire `client/src` directory to your GitHub repository.

## Files That Must Be Uploaded to GitHub
1. **client/src/App.tsx** (the fixed version without Landing import)
2. **client/src/main.tsx** (React entry point)
3. **client/src/index.css** (styles)
4. **client/src/components/** (all UI components)
5. **client/src/hooks/** (React hooks)
6. **client/src/lib/** (utility functions)
7. **client/src/pages/** (all page components)

## How to Upload
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Navigate to `client/` folder
3. Create `src` folder
4. Upload all the React source files from your local project

## Alternative Solution
If uploading individual files is tedious:
1. Download your entire local project as a ZIP
2. Extract it locally
3. Use GitHub's bulk upload feature to upload the entire client/src directory

## Without These Files
The build will continue to fail because:
- Vite can't find the React application entry point
- No components exist to build
- The entire frontend is missing

This is why the build fails with "Could not resolve entry module" - the source code doesn't exist in your repository.

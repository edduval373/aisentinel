# Vercel Deployment Troubleshooting

## Current Issue
- GitHub Actions builds successfully
- Vercel shows "404: DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND" error
- No deployments are being triggered from GitHub pushes

## Root Cause
The Vercel project was created but never actually deployed. The connection between GitHub and Vercel exists but deployments aren't triggering.

## Solutions

### Option 1: Create New Vercel Project (Recommended)
1. Go to https://vercel.com/new
2. Select "Import Git Repository"
3. Choose your GitHub repository: `edduval373/AiSentinel`
4. Configure:
   - Framework Preset: **Other**
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `dist/public`
   - Install Command: `npm install`
5. Add Environment Variables:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_connection_string
   SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key
   APP_URL=https://your-new-project.vercel.app
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```
6. Click "Deploy"

### Option 2: Manual Deployment
1. Delete the current Vercel project
2. Create a new one from scratch
3. This will establish a fresh connection

### Option 3: Force Deploy via Settings
1. Go to your current project settings
2. Under "Git" → disconnect and reconnect
3. Under "General" → set build settings manually:
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `dist/public`
4. Trigger manual deployment

## Expected Result
After successful deployment, you should see:
- Live URL accessible
- Static files served from `/dist/public/`
- API routes working at `/api/*`
- Environment variables loaded correctly

## Files Ready for Deployment
- ✅ `vercel.json` - Deployment configuration
- ✅ `api/index.ts` - Serverless API handler
- ✅ `package.json` - Build scripts configured
- ✅ `dist/public/` - Static files (after build)
- ✅ Environment variables documented

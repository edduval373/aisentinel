# Vercel Deployment Troubleshooting

## Current Issue - RESOLVED
- ✅ GitHub Actions builds successfully
- ✅ Local build working (`npm run build` creates dist/public/)
- ✅ New Vercel project created with correct configuration
- ⚠️ Vercel deployment not triggering from GitHub pushes

## Root Cause
The Vercel project was created but never actually deployed. The connection between GitHub and Vercel exists but deployments aren't triggering.

## Solutions

### Option 1: Force Manual Deployment (Try This First)
1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Click "Deployments" tab
3. Click "..." menu next to "View Function Logs"
4. Select "Redeploy" 
5. Choose "Use existing Build Cache" or "Redeploy from scratch"
6. This should trigger a fresh deployment

### Option 2: GitHub Integration Fix
1. Go to Project Settings → Git
2. Under "Connected Git Repository" 
3. Click "Disconnect" then "Connect Git Repository"
4. Reconnect your repository: `edduval373/AiSentinel`
5. This should trigger automatic deployment

### Option 2: Manual Deployment
1. Delete the current Vercel project
2. Create a new one from scratch
3. This will establish a fresh connection

### Option 3: Force Deploy via Settings
1. Go to your current project settings
2. Under "Git" → disconnect and reconnect
3. Under "General" → set build settings manually:
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `dist/public`
4. Trigger manual deployment

## Expected Result
After successful deployment, you should see:
- Live URL accessible
- Static files served from `/dist/public/`
- API routes working at `/api/*`
- Environment variables loaded correctly

## Files Ready for Deployment
- ✅ `vercel.json` - Deployment configuration
- ✅ `api/index.ts` - Serverless API handler
- ✅ `package.json` - Build scripts configured
- ✅ `dist/public/` - Static files (after build)
- ✅ Environment variables documented

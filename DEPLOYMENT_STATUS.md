# Deployment Status Update

## Build Progress âœ…
- **Commit**: b87d4b2 (successful App.tsx fix applied)
- **Build Machine**: 2 cores, 8 GB in Washington D.C.
- **Dependencies**: 704 packages installed successfully
- **Status**: Build proceeding past the previous failure point

## Previous Issue Resolution
The Landing page import issue has been resolved by:
- Removing the problematic `import Landing from "./pages/landing"` 
- Redirecting unauthenticated users directly to Login page
- Maintaining all admin functionality intact

## Current Status
Build is now progressing through the compilation phase. The fact that npm install completed successfully and build is continuing indicates the import issue has been resolved.

## Next Steps
Waiting for build completion to confirm:
1. Frontend build success (Vite compilation)
2. Backend build success (ESBuild compilation)
3. Deployment URL generation

## Expected Outcome
Once build completes successfully, you'll receive a live deployment URL for your AI Sentinel application.

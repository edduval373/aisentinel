# Deployment Status Update

## âœ… Fixed Issues
- **Package.json updated**: Build tools moved to dependencies
- **Dependencies installed**: 699 packages installed successfully
- **No "vite: command not found" error**: Build tools now available

## ðŸ”„ Current Status
- Build is progressing through npm install phase
- Security vulnerabilities noted (normal for large projects)
- Waiting for build command execution

## Next Expected Steps
1. **Build execution**: `npm run build` should run next
2. **Vite build**: Frontend compilation
3. **ESBuild**: Server compilation
4. **Deployment**: Static files and serverless functions

## If Build Succeeds
- You'll get a live URL
- Test authentication and email verification
- Verify all features work in production

## If Build Fails
- Check the next part of the logs
- Common issues: TypeScript errors, missing files, build configuration

Your package.json fix resolved the major dependency issue. The build should complete successfully now.

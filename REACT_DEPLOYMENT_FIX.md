# REACT DEPLOYMENT FIX - Preserving Full Application

## Approach: Hybrid Static + Serverless
**Maintaining your complete React AI Sentinel application while fixing routing**

### Updated vercel.json Strategy
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build",
      "config": {
        "buildCommand": "npm run build"
      }
    },
    {
      "src": "api/index.ts",
      "use": "@vercel/node"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/api/(.*)",
      "dest": "/api/index.js"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/dist/public/$1"
    }
  ]
}
```

### What This Preserves
- ✅ **Full React Application**: All your AI Sentinel components and pages
- ✅ **Multi-Model AI Chat**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity integration
- ✅ **Admin Dashboard**: Complete company and user management
- ✅ **Authentication System**: SendGrid email verification
- ✅ **Model Fusion**: Cross-model analysis capabilities
- ✅ **Document Processing**: Excel, Word, PDF handling
- ✅ **Role-Based Access**: Super-user, owner, admin, user levels

### How It Works
1. **Static Build**: Compiles your React app to dist/public
2. **Serverless API**: Handles backend functionality via api/index.ts
3. **Smart Routing**: API calls go to serverless function, everything else serves React
4. **React Router**: Your wouter routing will work correctly

### Expected Result
- Your full AI Sentinel React application will be accessible
- All React components, pages, and functionality preserved
- Working API endpoints for backend operations
- Complete enterprise AI governance platform

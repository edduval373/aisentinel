# Critical Production Fix Ready for Deployment

## Issue: 
Production site (aisentinel.app) shows blank page while development works perfectly

## Root Cause:
Vercel routing was serving HTML for CSS/JS files causing React app to fail loading

## Fix Applied:
1. **vercel.json**: Updated routing to exclude /assets/ from HTML rewrite using regex `/((?!assets/).*)`
2. **landing.tsx**: Replaced ALL broken Tailwind classes with inline CSS for guaranteed rendering
3. **Layout fixes**: 3-column grid, 2-column security section, blue CTA, footer - all working with inline styles

## Files Changed:
- vercel.json (critical routing fix)
- client/src/pages/landing.tsx (all layout sections fixed with inline CSS)
- force-deploy.txt (deployment marker)

## Expected Result:
Production will display beautiful AI Sentinel landing page matching development preview

## Deploy Status: READY - Push these changes to trigger Vercel deployment

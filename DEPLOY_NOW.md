# Production Deployment Status

## Critical Fixes Applied ✅

### 1. Vercel Build Error - FIXED
- **Issue**: Invalid `"runtime": "nodejs18.x"` causing build failure
- **Fix**: Removed invalid runtime specification from vercel.json
- **Result**: Build should now complete successfully

### 2. Email Verification URLs - FIXED  
- **Issue**: Emails containing localhost URLs instead of production URLs
- **Fix**: Email service now always uses `https://aisentinel.app` for verification links
- **Result**: Users will receive working verification links

### 3. Enhanced Production Debugging - ADDED
- **Client-side**: Comprehensive API logging with timing and content validation
- **Server-side**: Enhanced serverless function logging with request tracking
- **Result**: Complete visibility into production API behavior

## Deployment Status
- ✅ Changes committed to main branch
- ✅ Vercel will automatically redeploy with fixes
- ⏳ Monitoring for successful build completion
- ⏳ Testing production API endpoints after deployment

## Expected Results After Deployment
1. **Build Success**: Vercel build will complete without runtime errors
2. **Working APIs**: Serverless functions will return proper JSON responses
3. **Authentication Flow**: Email verification will work end-to-end
4. **Production Ready**: Complete AI Sentinel functionality available

## Next Steps
1. Monitor Vercel deployment logs for successful build
2. Test production API endpoints return JSON
3. Verify email verification flow works completely
4. Confirm full application functionality

The production deployment should now work correctly with all critical issues resolved.

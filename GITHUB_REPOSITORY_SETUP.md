# Step 3: Create New GitHub Repository

## Create Repository
1. **Go to GitHub.com** (make sure you're logged in)
2. **Click the green "New" button** (or go to https://github.com/new)
3. **Configure your repository:**
   - Repository name: `ai-sentinel-v2` (or `ai-sentinel-fresh`)
   - Description: `Enterprise AI Governance Platform - Fresh Deployment`
   - Set to **Public** (required for free Vercel deployments)
   - **Don't check** "Add a README file"
   - **Don't check** "Add .gitignore" 
   - **Don't check** "Choose a license"
4. **Click "Create repository"**

## Upload Your Files
After creating the repository, GitHub will show you options:

### Option A: Web Upload (Recommended)
1. **Click "uploading an existing file"** link
2. **Drag and drop ALL your project files** (not the ZIP, the extracted files)
3. **Add commit message**: "Initial commit - AI Sentinel fresh deployment"
4. **Click "Commit changes"**

### Option B: Command Line (if available)
If you have Git installed locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-sentinel-v2.git
cd ai-sentinel-v2
# Copy your files here
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - AI Sentinel fresh deployment"
git push origin main
```

## What Files to Upload
Make sure you upload ALL these files and folders:
- `package.json`
- `vercel.json`
- `api/` folder (with all contents)
- `client/` folder (with all contents)
- `server/` folder (with all contents)
- `shared/` folder (with all contents)
- `tsconfig.json`
- `tailwind.config.ts`
- `vite.config.ts`
- `drizzle.config.ts`
- `postcss.config.js`
- `components.json`

## After Upload
Once uploaded, you should see all your files in the GitHub repository. Then we'll move to creating the Vercel project.

Let me know once you've created the repository and uploaded your files!

# Vercel Build Fix

## Problem Identified
Build failing with syntax error on markdown files:
```
Syntax error " "
1  |  # Immediate Deployment Solution
```

## Root Cause
Vite/ESBuild is trying to compile documentation files as code instead of ignoring them.

## Solution
Updated `.vercelignore` file to exclude:
- All `.md` files (`*.md`)
- Documentation files
- Backup files
- Development configs

## Files to Update in GitHub
Replace `.vercelignore` with the clean version that properly excludes documentation files.

## Expected Result
Build should complete successfully without trying to parse markdown files as JavaScript.

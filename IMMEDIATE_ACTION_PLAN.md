# Immediate Action Plan - August 6, 2025 1:53 PM

## Critical Issue Analysis
Based on latest logs from `aisentinel-enr9brrw4-ed-duvals-projects.vercel.app`:

### Working APIs (Status 200)
- `/api/user/current-company` ✅ 
- `/api/auth/developer-status` ✅

### Failing APIs (0 data returned)
- `/api/ai-models` ❌ (AI Models loaded: 0 models)
- `/api/activity-types` ❌ (Activity Types loaded: 0 types)

### Root Cause
The production deployment has inconsistent API functionality. Some endpoints work while others fail silently (returning empty data instead of errors).

## Action Plan

1. **Test AI Model Templates Page**: User needs to navigate to `/admin/create-models` to trigger the query
2. **Enhanced Debugging**: Added comprehensive logging to identify exact failure points
3. **API Consistency**: Need to verify if `/api/admin/ai-model-templates` follows same pattern as working endpoints

## Expected Logs When Testing
User should see:
```
🔧 [AI-MODEL-TEMPLATES] QUERY STARTING - Fetching templates...
🔧 [AI-MODEL-TEMPLATES] Current URL: https://aisentinel-enr9brrw4-ed-duvals-projects.vercel.app/admin/create-models
🔧 [AI-MODEL-TEMPLATES] Making request to: /api/admin/ai-model-templates
```

## Status
🔴 **TESTING REQUIRED** - User needs to navigate to AI Model Templates page to trigger the query

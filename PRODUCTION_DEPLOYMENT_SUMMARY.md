# Production Deployment Summary - Urgent Fixes Applied

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Authentication Flow Issue ✅
**Problem**: After clearing cookies, production shows chat interface instead of landing page
**Root Cause**: Production API was auto-authenticating users without proper session tokens
**Fix Applied**: 
- Updated `api/index.js` authentication logic (lines 78-111)
- Now requires valid session token patterns: `dev-session-`, `prod-session-`, `replit-auth-`
- Returns `authenticated: false` when no valid token present

### 2. Company Display Issue ✅  
**Problem**: Production shows ugly "Demo Company" instead of real company data
**Root Cause**: Production API was returning hardcoded demo data instead of company ID 1 data
**Fix Applied**:
- Updated `api/index.js` company endpoint (lines 141-183)
- Now connects to actual PostgreSQL database to fetch real company data
- Returns correct "Duval AI Solutions" name, description, and full logo from database
- Includes all display settings (logoSize, showCompanyName, showCompanyLogo, companyNameSize)
- Updated user authentication response to show correct company name
- Added database fallback for resilient operation

## Expected Results After Deployment

### Authentication Flow:
- ✅ **No Cookies**: Landing page appears
- ✅ **Valid Session**: Chat interface loads  
- ✅ **Demo Mode**: `/demo` path shows demo interface

### Company Branding:
- ✅ **Company Name**: "Duval AI Solutions" (not "Demo Company")
- ✅ **Company Logo**: Proper logo from database  
- ✅ **Description**: "AI Governance Solutions Provider"

## Files Modified
- `api/index.js` - Production serverless function
- `replit.md` - Documentation updated
- `PRODUCTION_AUTHENTICATION_FIX.md` - Technical details

## Deployment Status
- ✅ **Fixes Applied**: Both authentication and company display issues resolved
- ⏳ **Needs Deployment**: Changes must be committed and pushed to trigger Vercel redeploy
- ⏳ **Testing Required**: Verify both fixes work in production after deployment

## Test Plan (After Deployment)
1. Clear cookies → Should show landing page
2. Navigate to `/demo` → Should show demo mode with "Duval AI Solutions"
3. Authenticate normally → Should show proper company branding
4. Verify no more "Demo Company" text appears anywhere

These fixes address both user-reported issues and ensure production matches development behavior.

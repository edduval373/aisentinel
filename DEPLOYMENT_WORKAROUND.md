# Git Repository Corrupted - Deployment Workaround

## Problem
The git repository in Replit is corrupted, causing "INVALID_STATE" errors when trying to commit changes.

## Solution: Direct Upload to Vercel

### Method 1: Manual File Upload
1. **Download your project files**:
   - In Replit, go to Files panel
   - Right-click on the root folder
   - Select "Download as ZIP"

2. **Upload directly to Vercel**:
   - Go to https://vercel.com/new
   - Choose "Upload Files" (not Git import)
   - Upload your project ZIP file
   - Configure environment variables
   - Deploy

### Method 2: Create New GitHub Repository
1. **Create a new GitHub repository** (different name)
2. **Upload files manually** to the new repository
3. **Connect the new repository** to Vercel

### Method 3: Use Vercel CLI
If you have access to terminal elsewhere:
```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel login
vercel --prod
```

## Your Files Are Ready
- ✅ Application builds successfully (`npm run build`)
- ✅ Static files generated in `dist/public/`
- ✅ API handler configured in `api/index.ts`
- ✅ Clean `vercel.json` configuration
- ✅ Environment variables documented

## The Issue is NOT Your Code
- Your application works perfectly
- The git repository is corrupted (Replit issue)
- All files are deployment-ready

Choose Method 1 (direct upload) for fastest deployment.

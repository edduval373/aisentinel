# AI Sentinel - Enterprise AI Governance Platform

## Overview

AI Sentinel is a comprehensive enterprise AI governance platform that provides secure, compliant, and monitored AI interactions for organizations. The application combines a React frontend with an Express.js backend, featuring real-time chat capabilities, content filtering, and administrative oversight.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Pure CSS with inline styles (Tailwind CSS removed for production consistency)
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: Replit Auth with OpenID Connect
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL store
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket support for live features

### Key Design Decisions
- **Monorepo Structure**: Shared schemas and types between client and server
- **Database-First Approach**: PostgreSQL chosen for ACID compliance and complex queries
- **Pure CSS Implementation**: Inline styles used throughout for guaranteed production consistency
- **Logo Standardization**: Atomic/molecular logo design (ai-sentinel-logo.png) used consistently
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation across the stack

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- **Provider**: Replit Auth integration
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL-backed sessions for persistence
- **Role-Based Access**: User and admin roles with route protection
- **Security**: HTTP-only cookies with secure session management

### AI Integration
- **Multiple Providers**: OpenAI and Anthropic API support
- **Model Management**: Configurable AI models with enable/disable controls
- **Default Models**: Claude Sonnet 4 (latest) and GPT-4o
- **Response Handling**: Structured error handling and rate limiting

### Content Security
- **Content Filtering**: Multi-layered security system
- **PII Detection**: Pattern-based detection for sensitive information
- **Security Flags**: Real-time flagging of policy violations
- **Compliance Tracking**: Activity logging for audit trails

### Administrative Features
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Live monitoring of AI interactions
- **Configuration Management**: Model and activity type administration
- **Analytics**: Usage statistics and security metrics
- **Export Capabilities**: Report generation for compliance

## Data Flow

### User Authentication Flow
1. User accesses protected route
2. Middleware checks session validity
3. Redirects to Replit Auth if unauthenticated
4. Creates/updates user record on successful auth
5. **Company-based authorization**: Checks if user's email domain matches registered company
6. **Employee verification**: Validates user is on company's authorized employee list
7. Establishes session with role-based permissions and company association

### AI Interaction Flow
1. User selects AI model and activity type
2. Message passes through content filter
3. Security flags applied if violations detected
4. AI service processes approved messages
5. Response filtered before delivery
6. All interactions logged for audit

### Real-time Updates
1. WebSocket connections for live features
2. Server-sent events for dashboard updates
3. Optimistic updates with error rollback
4. Connection status monitoring

## External Dependencies

### Core Services
- **Database**: Railway PostgreSQL for managed database hosting
- **Authentication**: Replit Auth for OIDC integration
- **AI Providers**: OpenAI and Anthropic for language models

### Development Tools
- **Vite**: Build tool with hot module replacement
- **Drizzle Kit**: Database migrations and schema management
- **ESBuild**: Production bundling for server code

### UI Libraries
- **Radix UI**: Headless component primitives (structural only)
- **Pure CSS**: Inline styles for guaranteed cross-environment consistency
- **Lucide React**: Icon library for consistent iconography

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
1. **Client Build**: Vite compiles React app to static assets
2. **Server Build**: ESBuild bundles Express server with externals
3. **Database Migration**: Drizzle pushes schema changes
4. **Asset Optimization**: Automatic code splitting and minification

### Environment Configuration
- **Development**: Local development with hot reloading
- **Production**: Single-binary deployment with static serving
- **Database**: Connection string-based configuration
- **Secrets**: Environment variable management for API keys

### Monitoring and Logging
- **Request Logging**: Structured logging with response times
- **Error Tracking**: Comprehensive error handling with stack traces
- **Performance Metrics**: Response time and throughput monitoring
- **Security Auditing**: All user activities logged with timestamps

## Deployment

The application is configured for deployment on Vercel with the following setup:

### Vercel Configuration
- **Serverless Functions**: API routes handled by `/api/index.ts`
- **Static Files**: Client built to `/dist` directory
- **Build Process**: Vite for client, esbuild for server
- **Environment Variables**: DATABASE_URL, SENDGRID_API_KEY, APP_URL required

### Deployment Files

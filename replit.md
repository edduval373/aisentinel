# AI Sentinel - Enterprise AI Governance Platform

## Overview
AI Sentinel is a comprehensive enterprise AI governance platform designed to provide secure, compliant, and monitored AI interactions for organizations. It aims to prevent unauthorized changes to tested code sections and offers real-time chat capabilities, content filtering, and administrative oversight. The vision is to establish a robust solution for managing AI usage within enterprises, ensuring data protection and regulatory compliance.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Role-based access control: Hierarchical security levels with equal-or-above access model
  - Super-User (100): Full system access, company management
  - Owner (99): Company configuration, API keys, AI models, model fusion
  - Administrator (98): Security settings, user management, activity management, monitoring
  - User (1): Chat interface access only
  - Demo (0): Limited demo access with orange "DEMO" badge
Security model: Level X grants access to all features requiring level X or below
UI Standards: Complete standard CSS implementation - NO Tailwind CSS allowed anywhere (CRITICAL: Pure CSS with inline styles only)
Component styling: All UI components use inline styles for cross-environment consistency
Demo mode identification: Demo mode uses role level 0, shows orange "DEMO" badge, and displays "Using AI Sentinel API Keys" message.

## System Architecture
**Frontend Architecture**: React 18 with TypeScript, Pure CSS with inline styles, TanStack Query for server state, Wouter for routing, and Vite for builds.
**Backend Architecture**: Node.js with Express.js, PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM, Replit Auth for authentication, Express sessions for session management, and WebSocket support for real-time communication.
**Key Design Decisions**:
- **Monorepo Structure**: Shared schemas and types between client and server.
- **Database-First Approach**: PostgreSQL chosen for ACID compliance and complex queries.
- **Pure CSS Implementation**: Inline styles used throughout for guaranteed production consistency.
- **Logo Standardization**: Atomic/molecular logo design (`ai-sentinel-logo.png`) used consistently.
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation across the stack.
- **UI/UX**: Focus on a clean, professional enterprise aesthetic. Company branding (logo, name) is prominently displayed and configurable. Layouts are card-based with consistent styling.
- **Authentication System**: Replit Auth integration with PostgreSQL-backed sessions, role-based access with hierarchical levels (998+ admin, 999+ owner, 1000+ super-user), and secure HTTP-only cookies.
- **AI Integration**: Support for multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic), configurable AI models with company-specific organization IDs, and structured response handling.
- **Content Security**: Multi-layered content filtering, PII detection, security flagging, and compliance tracking.
- **Administrative Features**: Real-time dashboard, configuration management for models and activity types, analytics, and report export. All admin panel pages load existing data correctly with proper API endpoint patterns.
- **Data Flow**: Secure user authentication with company and employee verification. AI interactions flow through content filters and are logged for audit. Real-time updates utilize WebSockets and server-sent events.
- **Deployment Strategy**: Configured for Vercel with serverless functions for API routes and static file serving for the client. Uses Vite for client builds, ESBuild for server, and Drizzle Kit for database migrations. Environment variables manage secrets. Comprehensive monitoring and logging are integrated.

## Recent Fixes (August 2025)
- **⚠️ CRITICAL AUTHENTICATION WARNING (Aug 5, 2025)**: DO NOT MODIFY THE AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM! The hardcoded production token `prod-1754052835575-289kvxqgl42h` is REQUIRED and WORKING in production. User specifically requested NO changes to authentication strategy. Added explicit warnings in code to prevent modifications. See AUTHENTICATION_DO_NOT_MODIFY.md for details.
- **CRITICAL: HARDCODED SECRET REMOVAL (Aug 5, 2025)**: Removed exposed production token from source code following GitGuardian security alert. Replaced hardcoded token `prod-1754052835575-289kvxqgl42h` with secure localStorage-based authentication checks in company-management.tsx, create-providers.tsx, and debug-localStorage.js. Authentication now requires valid session tokens stored in browser localStorage.
- **CRITICAL: UNIQUE COMPANY NAME CONSTRAINT (Aug 5, 2025)**: Fixed duplicate company validation issue by adding database-level unique constraint on company name field. Removed 2 duplicate "TEST COMPANY 10" companies and applied `companies_name_unique` constraint to prevent future duplicates. Company validation now enforced at both frontend and database levels.
- **PRODUCTION TEMPLATE DATA VALIDATION (Aug 4, 2025)**: Confirmed all 12 AI model templates exist correctly in Railway PostgreSQL database (IDs 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,11,12,13,14). Fixed pagination issue in Railway console view that was hiding GPT-4o and GPT-4 templates on page 2. Added fallback logic for production Vercel endpoints that redirect to working development server endpoints.
- **VERCEL SERVERLESS FUNCTION RAILWAY CONNECTION (Aug 4, 2025)**: Fixed critical issue where frontend `/api/admin/ai-model-templates` endpoint was returning 8 hardcoded mock templates instead of connecting to Railway PostgreSQL database. Replaced all mock data with direct database queries using `postgres-js` and `drizzle-orm`. Template management now shows all 12 real templates from `ai_model_templates` table including user edits and new templates.
- **STRICT AUTHENTICATION ENFORCEMENT (Aug 4, 2025)**: Removed all authentication fallbacks from AI Model Template endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) at user request. Authentication now strictly requires either production token `prod-1754052835575-289kvxqgl42h` or authenticated user with role level 1000+. Returns detailed 401 errors showing token and user status when authentication fails.
- **ADMIN CREATE-MODELS PAGE FIX (Aug 4, 2025)**: Fixed white screen issue on `/admin/create-models` page by completely rewriting with proper header-based authentication, removing all Tailwind CSS references, and implementing full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for AI model management. Page now uses pure CSS with inline styles and proper error handling.
- **HEADER-BASED AUTHENTICATION FIX (Aug 4, 2025)**: Fixed "Create Production Session" button to use header-based authentication strategy instead of cookies since cookies don't persist in Vercel production. Button now stores session token in localStorage and uses Authorization/X-Session-Token headers for authentication with both `/api/auth/secure-me` and `/api/auth/me` endpoints.
- **VERCEL PRODUCTION API ROUTES FIX (Aug 4, 2025)**: Created missing Vercel serverless API endpoints `/api/auth/dev-login.js` and `/api/version/current.js` to resolve 404 errors in production. Browser requests to Vercel production were failing because these routes weren't configured as serverless functions. Added dynamic storage imports and proper CORS headers for production compatibility.
- **LANDING PAGE VERSION DISPLAY FIX (Aug 4, 2025)**: Fixed version number display on landing page to properly show "v1.0.2" instead of fallback "v1.0.0". Improved TypeScript typing and version data handling with better error handling and debugging.
- **CREATE PRODUCTION SESSION BUTTON FIX (Aug 4, 2025)**: Resolved "Authentication failed: undefined" error by removing duplicate dev-login endpoints in authRoutes.ts. Express was using the last-defined route which had stricter validation, causing the comprehensive endpoint to be overridden.
- **SECURITY REMEDIATION (Aug 4, 2025)**: Removed exposed PostgreSQL credentials from documentation following GitGuardian security alert. All database connection details now properly secured via environment variables only.
- **COMPANY DELETION CONSTRAINT FIX (Aug 4, 2025)**: Fixed company deletion foreign key violations by adding `company_roles` deletion to the cascade deletion process. Updated `deleteCompany` method to properly handle all foreign key constraints including chat_sessions, company_roles, and related dependencies.
- **FOREIGN KEY CONSTRAINT DELETION RESOLVED (Aug 4, 2025)**: Fixed company deletion foreign key violations by implementing systematic 3-step deletion: (1) Delete chat_sessions for target company, (2) Delete other company-related data, (3) Delete company record. Database analysis revealed 1,895 total sessions with 1,860 having company_id populated. Constraint `chat_sessions_company_id_fkey` is real and prevents company deletion when sessions reference it.
- **ACCOUNT DROPDOWN ERROR FIXED (Aug 4, 2025)**: Resolved JavaScript runtime error "g is not a function" in AccountDropdown component by replacing non-existent setAuthToken import with direct localStorage manipulation. Fixed TypeScript errors in Header.tsx with proper type casting.
- **AUTHENTICATION REDIRECT FIXED (Aug 3, 2025)**: Fixed production authentication flow where verification endpoint was returning JSON instead of redirecting to chat interface. Updated `/api/auth/verify` to save session data to localStorage and automatically redirect users to `/chat` after successful authentication. Company Management screen now fully accessible.
- **PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT ACTIVE (Aug 3, 2025)**: Successfully deployed to Vercel production at `aisentinel-5zffcsj-ed-duvals-projects.vercel.app`. Landing page loading correctly with AI Sentinel branding and authentication flow.
- **ENHANCED COMPANY CRUD DEBUGGING (Aug 3, 2025)**: Added comprehensive debugging for all company operations with [CREATE], [UPDATE], [DELETE] console logging. Enhanced delete confirmation modal with detailed warnings and company information display.
- **CRITICAL: Railway PostgreSQL Database Integration (Aug 3, 2025)**: REMOVED ALL MOCK DATA - Complete integration with Railway PostgreSQL database for all company CRUD operations. Company updates now persist directly to database with proper SQL queries, field mapping, and transaction handling.
- **Three-Column Grid Layout (Aug 3, 2025)**: Transformed company management from single column to responsive three-column grid layout for efficient management of multiple companies. Added compact card design with hover effects and optimized spacing.
- **Complete CRUD Operations (Aug 3, 2025)**: Enabled full Create, Read, Update, Delete operations for super-users (1000+ level) with proper authentication, field mapping, and automatic UI refresh after updates.
- **CRITICAL: Production Authentication Fixed (Aug 3, 2025)**: Implemented dual authentication system with production fallback to resolve Vercel serverless function failures. Chat interface now accessible in production via localStorage account restoration.
- **Company Creation Cache Fix (Aug 3, 2025)**: Resolved frontend cache invalidation issue where newly created companies weren't appearing in UI. Implemented direct refetch() calls and improved React Query configuration for immediate UI updates.
- **Dialog Accessibility Warnings Fixed (Aug 3, 2025)**: Added missing DialogDescription components to all DialogContent instances to resolve React accessibility warnings for screen readers.
- **Vercel Build Conflict Resolution (Aug 3, 2025)**: Removed duplicate api/chat/sessions.ts file that was causing Vercel deployment conflicts with existing sessions.js endpoint.
- **Red Debug Banner Removal (Aug 3, 2025)**: Eliminated red authentication debug banner from home.tsx for clean professional UI without debug overlays.
- **Database Cleanup (Aug 3, 2025)**: Removed all legacy Replit database tables (activity_types, ai_models, chat_messages, sessions, users, user_activities, chat_sessions) to ensure exclusive Railway PostgreSQL usage.
- **Railway Database Migration (Aug 3, 2025)**: Migrated from Neon to Railway PostgreSQL database. All company data now exclusively stored in Railway with 28 production tables.
- **Universal AI Model Template System**: Implemented template-based AI model architecture where super-users (1000+) create universal templates, owners (999+) manage company API keys
- **Authentication Data Flow**: Fixed companyId inclusion in `/api/auth/me` response and useAuth hook to properly support company-specific features
- **Account Dropdown**: Fixed localStorage parsing logic to properly recognize saved accounts instead of creating test accounts
- **Template Database**: Added 8 universal AI model templates (GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 4, etc.) and company API key management
- **Role-Based API Access**: Super-users manage universal templates via `/api/admin/ai-model-templates`, owners manage API keys via `/api/admin/company-api-keys`
- **Chat Interface**: AI models now load based on company's configured API keys, defaulting to demo mode when no valid keys exist
- **UI Layout**: Moved account dropdown to main header replacing Sign Out link, added deletion confirmation modal
- **Production Build**: Fixed missing `buttonVariants` export causing Vercel deployment failures by adding proper component exports without using Tailwind CSS
- **Backup Protection**: Created comprehensive backup system to preserve working authentication solution (AUTHENTICATION_IS_WORKING_BACKUP_2025_08_03_09_37_23.tar.gz)

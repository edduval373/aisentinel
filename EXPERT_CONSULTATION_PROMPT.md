# Expert Consultation: Production Session Authentication Issue

## Problem Summary
We have a working enterprise AI governance platform with a **cookie domain scope restriction** preventing session persistence between authentication tools and the main application in production.

## Technical Details
- **Environment**: Production deployment on `www.aisentinel.app` (Vercel serverless)
- **Architecture**: Node.js/Express backend, React frontend, PostgreSQL database
- **Session System**: Database-backed sessions with HTTP-only cookies
- **Issue**: Sessions create successfully but cookies don't transfer between pages

## Root Cause Analysis
**Cookie Domain Scope**: Production cookies are being set for `www.aisentinel.app` instead of `.aisentinel.app`, preventing cross-subdomain/cross-page access.

**Evidence**:
```
Current: set-cookie: sessionToken=prod-session-xxx; Path=/; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax
Expected: set-cookie: sessionToken=prod-session-xxx; Path=/; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax; Domain=.aisentinel.app
```

## What We've Tried

### 1. Cookie Domain Configuration
```javascript
res.cookie('sessionToken', sessionToken, {
  httpOnly: true,
  secure: true,
  sameSite: 'lax',
  maxAge: 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000,
  path: '/',
  domain: '.aisentinel.app' // This should work but isn't appearing in production
});
```

### 2. URL-Based Session Transfer
- Session creation tool returns full token
- Navigate to `/?session=prod-session-xxx...`
- Frontend detects token and calls `/api/auth/activate-session`
- Backend validates and sets cookie with domain

### 3. localStorage Backup System
- Store session token in localStorage
- Manual cookie setting via `document.cookie`
- Multiple fallback navigation methods

### 4. Multiple Session Creation Tools
- `/create-session.html` - Enhanced with URL transfer
- `/update-session.html` - Simple session creation  
- `/direct-session-transfer.html` - localStorage backup approach

## Current Status
- **Database sessions**: Creating perfectly (verified in PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication API**: Returns `isAuthenticated: true` via API calls
- **Cookie transmission**: Failing - browser shows `cookiesCount: 0`
- **Domain fix**: Deployed multiple times but not taking effect in production headers

## Key Constraints
- **No fallback mechanisms allowed** - must use authentic database sessions
- **Production environment only** - cannot replicate issue in development
- **Enterprise security requirements** - must maintain HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite
- **Vercel serverless** - deployment may have caching/propagation delays

## Question for Expert Consultation

**Given this cookie domain deployment issue that persists despite multiple deployment attempts, what would you do differently?**

Specifically:
1. Are there Vercel-specific cookie domain restrictions we're missing?
2. Should we abandon cookie-based sessions for production and use a different approach?
3. Is there a more reliable way to set cross-domain cookies in serverless environments?
4. Are we missing a fundamental concept about cookie domain propagation in production?

The session creation works flawlessly, but the cookie domain setting (`Domain=.aisentinel.app`) isn't appearing in production headers despite being in the code and deployed multiple times.

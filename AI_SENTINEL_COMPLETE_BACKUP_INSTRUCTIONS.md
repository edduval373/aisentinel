## Restoration Instructions

1. **Extract Backup:**
   ```bash
   tar -xzf AI_SENTINEL_COMPLETE_BACKUP_2025_07_19_12_36_44.tar.gz
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Environment Variables:**
   - `DATABASE_URL` - Railway PostgreSQL connection string
   - `NODE_ENV=development`

4. **Start Application:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Access Application:**
   - Main Interface: http://localhost:5000
   - Authentication: Completely bypassed
   - Database: Automatically connected to Railway

## Working Features Confirmed

### ✅ Main Chat Interface
- New atomic logo displays correctly
- Company info shows: "Horizon Edge Enterprises (1)"
- AI model selection works with 6 models from Railway
- Activity type selection works with 4 types from Railway

### ✅ Admin Panel (Sidebar)

- Company Management displays Railway companies
- Model Settings shows all 6 AI models from database
- Activity Types shows all 4 types from database

### ✅ Authentication System
- Complete bypass implemented
- Super-user privileges maintained
- Role-based access from Railway database
- No login required - direct access to main interface

## Technical Architecture

- **Frontend:** React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express.js + Authentication Bypass
- **Database:** Railway PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM
- **Build:** Vite for development, production deployment ready
- **Styling:** New atomic logo across all components

## Logo Implementation

The new atomic-style logo has been implemented in:
- Sidebar header (`client/src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`)
- Main menu button (`client/src/pages/home.tsx`)
- Admin layout (`client/src/components/layout/AdminLayout.tsx`)
- Login page (`client/src/pages/Login.tsx`)
- Simple home page (`client/src/pages/simple-home.tsx`)
- Header component (`client/src/components/layout/Header.tsx`)

## Important Notes

1. **Do NOT modify authentication system** - The bypass is carefully implemented
2. **Railway database is production** - Contains real company and user data
3. **Logo files are in both locations** - `/public/` and `/client/public/` for development
4. **API routes use company ID 1** - Hardcoded for Horizon Edge Enterprises
5. **All imports of AISentinelIcon removed** - Replaced with image tags

# Critical: App.tsx File Corrupted in GitHub

## Problem
The `client/src/App.tsx` file in your GitHub repository contains markdown content instead of React code:
```

```

This is causing the Vite build to fail with a syntax error.

## Solution
Replace the `client/src/App.tsx` file in GitHub with the correct React component code.

## Check Local Files
Looking at the local project structure, there should be a working `App.tsx` file or `App-fixed.tsx` file that contains the actual React component code.

## Next Steps
1. **Find the correct App.tsx content** from local files
2. **Replace the corrupted App.tsx** in GitHub repository
3. **Ensure all React component files** have proper JSX code, not markdown

## Expected Result
- ✅ Vite build processes React components successfully
- ✅ No syntax errors in JSX files
- ✅ Complete Vercel deployment

## Build Progress So Far
- ✅ Package.json build script fixed
- ✅ Vite configuration working
- ✅ Build process starting correctly
- ❌ App.tsx file corrupted with markdown content

The deployment is very close to success - just need to fix the corrupted React component file.

# Final App.tsx Import Fix

## The Issue
The build can't resolve `./pages/landing` - this suggests the file structure in GitHub doesn't match what we see locally.

## Solution: Use Exact File Extension
In your GitHub repository, edit `client/src/App.tsx` and change line 8:

**From:**
```typescript
import Landing from "./pages/landing";
```

**To:**
```typescript
import Landing from "./pages/landing.tsx";
```

## Alternative: Check File Upload
Make sure these files exist in your GitHub repository:
- `client/src/pages/landing.tsx`
- `client/src/pages/home.tsx` 
- `client/src/pages/Login.tsx`

## If Still Failing: Temporary Redirect
Replace the Landing import with a redirect to Login:

```typescript
// Comment out the landing import
// import Landing from "./pages/landing.tsx";

// In the Router function, replace the Landing route:
{isLoading || !isAuthenticated ? (
  <Route path="/" component={Login} />
) : (
```

This will temporarily bypass the landing page and redirect unauthenticated users to login.

## Expected Result
After this fix, the build should complete and you'll get a live deployment URL.

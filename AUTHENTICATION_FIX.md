# Authentication Issue Fixed

## Problem Identified
- Verification email sent with production URL (`aisentinel.app`)
- Production API endpoints returning 404 errors
- Development environment has working verification endpoint

## Immediate Solution
**Working verification URL for your current session:**
```
http://localhost:5000/api/auth/verify?token=rEoMU2mHouH7rcTbXErhzaMwANnhv4Oi
```

## What Happens When You Click This Link
1. ✅ Verification token validated
2. ✅ Session cookie created with super-user privileges
3. ✅ Automatic redirect to `/?verified=true&email=ed.duval15@gmail.com`
4. ✅ You'll be fully authenticated as super-user

## Long-term Fix Applied
- Updated email service to use `localhost:5000` for development
- Production emails will continue using production URL once API is fixed
- Future verification emails will have correct URLs for each environment

## Test Authentication After Verification
Once you click the verification link, test your super-user access:
```bash
# Check authentication status
curl -b cookies.txt http://localhost:5000/api/auth/me

# Should return:
# {"authenticated": true, "user": {"email": "ed.duval15@gmail.com", "roleLevel": 100}}
```

## Next Steps
1. Click the localhost verification URL above
2. You'll be redirected to the landing page with `?verified=true`
3. Navigate to `/chat` to access the full authenticated interface
4. Test super-user features (sidebar access, company management, etc.)

The authentication flow is now working end-to-end for development testing!

# Development Authentication Fix

## Current Status ✅
The development authentication system is working and the yellow development box is visible on your landing page.

## Issue Resolution
I've implemented a complete development authentication system that:
1. Creates user and company records in your development database
2. Generates a proper session token
3. Sets authentication cookies for the development domain

## To Test Authentication
1. **In Development**: Click the "Authenticate for Development" button in the yellow box
2. **Or navigate directly to**: `/chat` after clicking the button
3. **Manual test**: Use the development authentication endpoint via the button

## Production Status
The production authentication is also fixed:
- Email verification creates session cookies ✅
- Production API now recognizes those cookies ✅
- Auto-redirect functionality implemented ✅

## Both Environments Ready
Both production (`aisentinel.app`) and development (Replit) authentication flows are now complete and functional.

## Expected Flow
1. **Production**: Email verification → Session cookie → Auto-redirect to chat
2. **Development**: Click dev button → Session cookie → Redirect to chat

The authentication system is working correctly on both environments!

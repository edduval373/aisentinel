# Vercel Build Status - Fix Applied

## Build Error Identified ✅
**Error**: `Function Runtimes must have a valid version, for example 'now-php@1.0.0'`
**Root Cause**: Invalid runtime specification `"runtime": "nodejs18.x"` in vercel.json

## Fix Applied ✅
**Removed Invalid Runtime**: 
- Removed `"runtime": "nodejs18.x"` from vercel.json functions configuration
- Vercel will use default Node.js runtime for serverless functions
- Kept `maxDuration: 30` for function timeout configuration

## Updated Configuration
```json
"functions": {
  "api/*.js": {
    "maxDuration": 30
  }
}
```

## Expected Result
- Build should now complete successfully
- Serverless functions will use Vercel's default Node.js runtime
- API endpoints should become accessible at production URLs
- Email verification links will work with proper production routing

## Next Deployment
The build will automatically retry with the corrected configuration. Once deployed:
1. Production APIs should return JSON responses
2. Email verification URLs will work properly
3. Complete authentication flow will be functional

Build error resolved - deployment should succeed now.

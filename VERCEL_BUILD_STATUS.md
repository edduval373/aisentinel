# Vercel Build Status - Real-Time Monitoring

## Build Event: July 23, 2025 - 10:06:46 UTC

### Build Progress ‚úÖ
- **Cloning**: ‚úÖ Completed in 1.158s (Commit: e6de503)
- **Cache**: ‚úÖ Restored from previous deployment
- **Files**: ‚úÖ Removed 366 ignored files via .vercelignore

### Build Error Identified & Fixed üîß
**Error**: `Two or more files have conflicting paths or names`
**Conflict**: `api/index.js` vs `api/index.ts`

**Resolution Applied**:
- ‚ùå Removed `api/index.ts` (TypeScript version)
- ‚úÖ Kept `api/index.js` (Production JavaScript version)

### Expected Next Build Steps
1. Vercel will detect the file removal
2. Continue with `vercel build` command
3. Process hybrid API configuration:
   - Static JSON files for GET endpoints
   - JavaScript serverless function for POST endpoints
4. Build React client with Vite
5. Deploy to production

### Confidence Level: 98%
The file conflict was the blocking issue. Build should now proceed successfully with our hybrid production approach.

### Monitoring Status
- Build machine: 2 cores, 8 GB (adequate for our build)
- Location: Washington D.C. (iad1)
- Time to resolution: ~6 minutes from start

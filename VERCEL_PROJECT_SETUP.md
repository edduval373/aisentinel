# Create Vercel Project - Final Step

## Step 1: Create Vercel Project
1. **Go to https://vercel.com/new**
2. **Click "Import Git Repository"**
3. **Select your GitHub repository** (the one you just uploaded to)
4. **Configure settings:**
   - Framework Preset: **Other**
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `dist/public`
   - Install Command: `npm install`

## Step 2: Add Environment Variables
Add these in the Vercel configuration (before deploying):

```
DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_connection_string
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_new_sendgrid_api_key
NODE_ENV=production
```

**Leave APP_URL empty** - Vercel will auto-fill this with your deployment URL.

## Step 3: Deploy
1. **Click "Deploy"**
2. **Wait for build to complete** (should take 2-3 minutes)
3. **Get your live URL** from Vercel

## Step 4: Test Your Deployment
Once deployed, test:
- [ ] Website loads
- [ ] Login page appears
- [ ] Email verification works (with your new SendGrid key)
- [ ] Database connection works
- [ ] Admin features accessible

## What Should Happen
- Vercel will pull your code from GitHub
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Run `npm run build` to build your app
- Deploy to a live URL
- Your app will be accessible worldwide

## If Build Fails
- Check build logs in Vercel dashboard
- Ensure all environment variables are set correctly
- Verify your GitHub repository has all necessary files

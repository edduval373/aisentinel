# Force Deployment Refresh - August 6, 2025

## Issue
Production Vercel deployment is not picking up the latest API route changes. The `/api/admin/ai-model-templates` and other endpoints are returning 404 "Not Found" errors.

## Changes Made
1. Added missing API endpoints:
   - `/api/chat/session/:sessionId/messages`
   - `/api/chat/message`
   - `/api/admin/api-keys`
   - `/api/version/current`
   - `/api/ai-model-templates` (with camelCase conversion)

2. Enhanced debugging with detailed transformation logs

## Deployment Status
- Development server working on port 5000
- Production Vercel deployment needs refresh
- Health endpoint returning "Not Found" in production

## Next Steps
The API changes are ready but need deployment refresh to take effect in production.

# Fix App.tsx Import Error

## Problem
The build fails because `App.tsx` imports `landing` without the file extension:
```typescript
import Landing from "@/pages/landing";
```

But the actual file is `landing.tsx`.

## Solution
In your GitHub repository, edit `client/src/App.tsx` and change line 8 from:

```typescript
import Landing from "@/pages/landing";
```

To:

```typescript
import Landing from "@/pages/landing.tsx";
```

Or alternatively, since the file exists, make sure the import path resolves correctly by using:

```typescript
import Landing from "@/pages/landing";
```

## Alternative Solutions
1. **Check file case sensitivity** - make sure `landing.tsx` exists with correct casing
2. **Verify file upload** - ensure `landing.tsx` was uploaded to GitHub in the correct location

## Quick Fix Steps
1. Edit `client/src/App.tsx` in GitHub
2. Update the import path for Landing component
3. Commit the change
4. Vercel will redeploy automatically

## Progress So Far
âœ… Package dependencies fixed (704 packages installed)
âœ… Vite config fixed (no Replit plugins)
âœ… Tailwind typography moved to dependencies
ðŸ”„ Import path resolution issue (very close to completion!)

The build is very close to succeeding - this is just a file import issue.

# How to Complete Authentication for ed.duval15@gmail.com

## Current Status
✅ **Backend authentication working perfectly**
✅ **Email verification system working**
✅ **Session creation working**
❌ **Browser needs to receive session cookie**

## What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Click the Verification Link
Use this verification URL (valid for 1 hour):
```
http://localhost:5000/api/auth/verify?token=rr_RVCdImepmlz8d643TD8uK__KL1N2w
```

### Step 2: What Will Happen
1. The verification URL will set a session cookie in your browser
2. You'll be redirected to: `/?verified=true&email=ed.duval15@gmail.com`
3. The React app will detect the verification success and refresh your authentication
4. You'll see the AI Sentinel dashboard instead of the landing page

### Step 3: Verify Success
After clicking the link, you should see:
- Your super-user dashboard (role level 100)
- Company: Horizon Edge Enterprises
- Full access to all admin features

## Alternative Method
If the link doesn't work, I can manually set the session cookie for testing purposes.

## Current Valid Sessions
Your account has 3 valid session tokens in the database, but your browser needs to receive one through the verification process.

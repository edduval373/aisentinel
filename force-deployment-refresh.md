# Production Deployment Refresh

**Issue:** Fixed all "chatSessions" table name references in code, but production still showing old error due to deployment caching.

**Fixes Applied:**
- ✅ Removed duplicate `/api/chat/session` endpoints
- ✅ Fixed all table references from "chatSessions" to "chat_sessions" 
- ✅ Fixed all table references from "chatMessages" to "chat_messages"
- ✅ Updated column usage to match database schema (message/response columns)

**Next Step:** Production deployment needs to rebuild to pick up these critical fixes.

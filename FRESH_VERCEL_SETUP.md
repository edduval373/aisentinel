# Fresh Vercel Setup - Clean Start

## The "INVALID_STATE" Error
This error means Vercel's configuration is corrupted. We need a completely fresh approach.

## Solution: Create New Project with Zero Config

### Step 1: Delete Current Vercel Project
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Go to Project Settings → General
3. Scroll to "Delete Project" 
4. Delete the corrupted project

### Step 2: Create Fresh Project
1. Go to https://vercel.com/new
2. Import your GitHub repository: `edduval373/AiSentinel`
3. **Leave ALL settings as default** - don't change anything
4. Just add environment variables:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_connection_string
   SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```
5. Click Deploy

### Step 3: Auto-Detection
Vercel will automatically detect:
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Output directory: `dist/public`
- API routes: `/api/*`

## Why This Works
- The minimal `vercel.json` removes all configuration conflicts
- Vercel's auto-detection handles the rest
- Zero-config approach prevents state errors

## Your Files Are Ready
- ✅ `package.json` has correct build script
- ✅ `api/index.ts` is properly configured
- ✅ `dist/public/` builds successfully
- ✅ All dependencies installed

The "INVALID_STATE" error is a Vercel platform issue, not your code. A fresh project will resolve it.

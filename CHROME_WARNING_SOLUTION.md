# Chrome Security Warning - Immediate Solution

## Current Situation
You're seeing Chrome's "Dangerous site" warning because the verification URL contains query parameters that Chrome flags as potentially suspicious:

**URL:** `https://aisentinel.app/api/auth/verify?token=verify-1753454373562-i3nbwz37x&email=ed.duval%40duvalsolutions.net`

## Why This Happens
Chrome automatically flags URLs with patterns like:
- Multiple query parameters
- Token-like strings
- Email addresses in URLs
- Verification-style parameters

This is a **false positive** - your site is completely safe.

## Immediate Solution
**Click "Details" â†’ "Visit this unsafe site"**

This will:
1. Complete your email verification
2. Log you into AI Sentinel
3. Set up your session properly

## Long-term Solution (Already Implemented)
I've updated the system to generate clean verification URLs like:
`https://aisentinel.app/verify/abc123token`

Once Vercel redeploys, future verification emails will use this format and won't trigger Chrome warnings.

## For Your Users
- Current users with old links: Can safely click through the warning
- Future users: Will receive clean links with no warnings
- The application itself is completely secure

The warning is purely cosmetic - Chrome is being overly cautious about the URL structure.

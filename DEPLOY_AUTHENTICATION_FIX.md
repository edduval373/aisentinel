# Authentication Fix Deployment Status

## Current Issue
- Verification link on production (https://aisentinel.app) shows "FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED" error
- Serverless function is crashing due to missing authentication logic with session creation

## Fix Applied
✅ **Updated api/index.ts with complete authentication flow:**
- Added proper verification endpoint with session creation
- Implemented session cookie setting with HttpOnly, Secure flags
- Added /api/auth/me endpoint matching frontend expectations
- Added proper error handling and HTML responses for verification

## Key Changes Made
1. **Enhanced verification endpoint** - Now creates user sessions and sets cookies
2. **Added session cookie handling** - Proper HTTP-only cookies with security flags
3. **Frontend compatibility** - /api/auth/me endpoint matches useAuth hook expectations
4. **Error handling** - Proper HTML error pages for verification failures

## Deployment Required
The fixes are ready but need to be deployed to Vercel production:

1. The local authentication works perfectly (confirmed with curl tests)
2. The serverless function has been updated with all necessary changes
3. Production deployment will resolve the verification link failures

## Test Results (Local)
✅ Email verification creates session successfully
✅ Session cookies set with proper security flags
✅ Authentication endpoint returns user data correctly
✅ Super-user permissions verified (role level 100)

## Next Steps
1. Deploy to Vercel production
2. Test verification link on https://aisentinel.app
3. Confirm authentication flow works end-to-end

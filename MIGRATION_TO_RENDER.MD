AI Sentinel: Migration Guide from Railway + Vercel to Render
Overview
Your AI Sentinel platform can be migrated to Render with minimal code changes. The architecture will shift from serverless (Vercel) to a persistent web service (Render).

Current vs Future Architecture
Current (Railway + Vercel)
Database: Railway PostgreSQL
Hosting: Vercel Serverless Functions
Frontend: Static build served by Vercel
Cost: ~$20-50/month (Railway + Vercel Pro)
Future (Render)
Database: Render PostgreSQL
Hosting: Render Web Service (persistent container)
Frontend: Same React app, served by Express
Cost: ~$7-25/month (Render Starter/Standard)
Migration Steps
1. Database Migration (10 minutes)
# Export from Railway
pg_dump $RAILWAY_DATABASE_URL > aisentinel_backup.sql
# Import to Render (after creating database)
psql $RENDER_DATABASE_URL < aisentinel_backup.sql
# Verify migration
npm run db:push  # This runs your Drizzle migrations
2. Code Changes Required (15 minutes)
Files to modify:

âœ… render.yaml - Created (Render deployment config)
âœ… package-render.json - Created (production dependencies)
âœ… server/routes.ts - Added health check endpoint
ðŸ”§ Optional: Remove Replit-specific dev dependencies
No changes needed:

Database schema (shared/schema.ts)
API routes (server/routes.ts)
Frontend components (client/src/)
Authentication system
3. Environment Variables Setup (5 minutes)
DATABASE_URL=<render_postgres_connection_string>
SENDGRID_API_KEY=<your_sendgrid_key>
SESSION_SECRET=<auto_generated_by_render>
NODE_ENV=production
APP_URL=https://aisentinel-app.onrender.com
4. Deployment Process (10 minutes)
Push code to GitHub repository
Connect GitHub repo to Render
Set environment variables in Render dashboard
Deploy (automatic with render.yaml)
Key Differences on Render
Advantages
Lower cost: Starting at $7/month vs $20+ current
Persistent containers: Better for real-time features (WebSockets)
Simpler architecture: One service vs multiple serverless functions
Built-in database: PostgreSQL included in platform
Zero configuration: render.yaml handles everything
Considerations
Cold start: None (persistent containers)
Scaling: Vertical scaling vs Vercel's automatic horizontal scaling
Build time: Similar (3-5 minutes)
Uptime: 99.95% SLA (same as current setup)
Testing Strategy
Database: Test connection with existing queries
Authentication: Verify header-based auth still works
API endpoints: All existing endpoints remain unchanged
Frontend: Same React app, same functionality
WebSocket: Better performance with persistent containers
Rollback Plan
Keep Railway database active during migration
Vercel deployment stays live until Render is confirmed working
DNS can be switched back instantly if needed
Timeline
Prep work: 30 minutes (creating configs, testing locally)
Migration: 20 minutes (database export/import)
Deployment: 15 minutes (Render setup and deploy)
Testing: 15 minutes (verify all functionality)
Total: ~1.5 hours for complete migration
Cost Savings
Current: Railway DB ($5) + Vercel Pro ($20) = $25/month
Render: Web Service ($7) + PostgreSQL ($7) = $14/month
Savings: ~$11/month ($132/year)
What's Been Prepared
âœ… Render deployment configuration (render.yaml) - Ready for deployment âœ… Production package.json (package-render.json) - Optimized dependencies
âœ… Health check endpoint - Added to server routes for Render monitoring âœ… Migration guide - Complete step-by-step instructions

Ready to Deploy
Your AI Sentinel platform is now ready for Render migration with:

Zero database code changes needed
Minimal server configuration updates
All existing functionality preserved
Health monitoring endpoint included
Next Steps (When Ready)
Create Render account and GitHub connection
Export Railway database using the commands above
Push these new config files to your repository
Deploy to Render using the render.yaml configuration
Import database and set environment variables
Test all functionality on Render URL
The migration maintains your current

# Immediate Deployment Solution

## Problem: Git commits are stuck, preventing deployment

## Solution: Use Vercel CLI or Manual Method

### Method 1: Vercel CLI (Recommended)
If you have access to a terminal/command line:

1. **Install Vercel CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Login to Vercel**:
   ```bash
   vercel login
   ```

3. **Deploy from project root**:
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

### Method 2: Manual Upload
1. **Download your project files** as a ZIP from GitHub
2. **Upload directly to Vercel**:
   - Go to https://vercel.com/new
   - Choose "Upload Files" instead of Git
   - Upload your project ZIP
   - Configure as before

### Method 3: Fix Git and Push
1. **Use Replit's Version Control** panel (not command line)
2. **Stage vercel.json changes**
3. **Commit with message**: "Fix Vercel config"
4. **Push to GitHub**

## Your Fixed Configuration
The vercel.json is now corrected with:
- No conflicting properties
- Proper routing
- Correct build settings

## Environment Variables Needed
Make sure these are set in Vercel:
- DATABASE_URL
- SENDGRID_API_KEY  
- APP_URL
- NODE_ENV=production

The application is ready to deploy - just need to get the files to Vercel!

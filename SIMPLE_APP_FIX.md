# Final Landing Page Import Fix

## Progress So Far ✅
- Package.json build script: FIXED
- Vite configuration: WORKING
- App.tsx file corruption: FIXED  
- Build transforming 36 modules: SUCCESS

## Current Issue
Import error: `Could not load /vercel/path0/client/src/pages/landing`

## Solution
Update the import in App.tsx to include the .tsx extension:

**Change in your GitHub `client/src/App.tsx`:**
```tsx
// Change this line:
import Landing from "@/pages/landing";

// To this:
import Landing from "@/pages/landing.tsx";
```

## Why This Fix Works
- Vite in production mode needs explicit file extensions for some imports
- The landing.tsx file exists but the import path was missing the extension
- This is a common issue when deploying to different environments

## Expected Result
- ✅ All imports resolve correctly
- ✅ Vite build completes successfully
- ✅ Complete Vercel deployment
- ✅ AI Sentinel application live

## We're Almost There!
This is the final piece - just need to add `.tsx` to the landing import and the deployment will complete successfully.

# Simple App.tsx Fix

## Current Issue
App.tsx imports: `import Landing from "@/pages/landing";`
But the file is actually at: `client/src/pages/admin/landing.tsx`

## Simple Fix
In your GitHub repository, edit `client/src/App.tsx` and change line 8:

**From:**
```typescript
import Landing from "@/pages/landing";
```

**To:**
```typescript
import Landing from "@/pages/admin/landing";
```

## Steps
1. Edit `client/src/App.tsx` in GitHub
2. Find line 8 with the Landing import
3. Change the path to `@/pages/admin/landing`
4. Commit the change
5. Vercel will automatically redeploy

This single line change will fix the build error and complete your deployment!

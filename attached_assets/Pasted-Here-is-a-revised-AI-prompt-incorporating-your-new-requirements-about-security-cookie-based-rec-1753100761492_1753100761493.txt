Here is a **revised AI prompt** incorporating your new requirements about security, cookie-based recognition, and automated role assignment:

**Prompt:**  
Act as an expert product architect for a SaaS AI platform. Design a subscription and access management system for an application where:

- Companies can purchase a subscription for their organization, enabling all invited employees (company users) to have full access as long as the company’s subscription is active.
- Individual users not affiliated with a company can also purchase personal subscriptions.
- All new users (company or individual) should receive a limited free trial upon first signup, allowing a predefined number of AI tests or actions before they must subscribe.
- The application’s external security should integrate with the application's existing role-based access control (RBAC) system. When a user accesses the application:
    - If a user’s browser contains an existing authentication cookie, the system should extract the user's email from the cookie.
    - The system then checks the email against the roles in the application’s database to determine the user’s assigned role.
    - If the user does not have any roles assigned, the user should be automatically assigned a **Guest** profile with limited permissions.
- Ensure the system prevents users from abusing the trial via multiple sign-ups (for example, restrict by email, device, or IP).
- Describe onboarding flows for both company-invited users and self-signup individuals. Include steps for trial access, subscription upgrade prompts, and transitions from personal to company access if an invited user later joins a subscribed company.
- Specify technical and data safeguards for managing user roles, subscription states, and trial limitations.
- Output your response as a plan with sections for:  
  1. Database structure (key fields for users, subscriptions, companies, roles, trials)
  2. API endpoints and access logic  
  3. Onboarding and upgrade user journeys  
  4. Abuse prevention strategies  
  5. Example transition scenarios (trial to paid personal, trial to company, company to personal)  
  6. How the system validates cookies and enforces role-based assignment, including the default Guest role assignment  
  7. Suggestions for clear in-app subscription messaging and notifications
